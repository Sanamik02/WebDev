    New Year’s Day, a happy day!<br>
    We are glad and want to play.<br>
    We all dance and sing and say,<br>
    «Welcome! Welcome, New Year’s Day!»<br>
    </p>
    
    <p class="NewYear-poem">
    Make a wish, it is almost 12 o`Clock,<br>
    And open the door, New Year will knock.<br>
    Then call to congratulate everybody,<br>
    Today we will make unforgettable party.<br>

    <h2>Nobody</h2>

    <p1 id="nobody">
        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br></em>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.<br></strong>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        <strong><em>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</em></strong>
